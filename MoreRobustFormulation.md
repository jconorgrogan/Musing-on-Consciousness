# A Computational Framework for Consciousness: Recursive Processing, Imperfect Encoding, and Subject-Level Error Detection

## Introduction

Consciousness, defined as subjective experience or awareness, remains an unresolved enigma in science and philosophy. Existing theories like Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT) address specific facets—IIT focuses on the integration of information as a measure of consciousness (Tononi, 2008), while GWT emphasizes the broadcasting of information across neural networks (Baars, 1988; Dehaene & Changeux, 2011). However, these frameworks often lack a unified account that bridges the underlying mechanisms with the phenomenology of consciousness, particularly the subjective experience of self and time. Other perspectives, such as predictive processing (PP) (Friston, 2010), prioritize error minimization, while panpsychism posits consciousness as a fundamental property (Goff, 2017), yet neither fully integrates mechanism and experience.

This paper proposes a novel computational framework where consciousness emerges from recursive informational processing. It integrates three core components:

- **Universal Tape Model**: Conceptualizes the universe as an evolving informational state, with observers encoding imperfect memories of this state.
- **Context-Invariant Representations**: Highlights human-specific stable neural coding, independent of context, critical for self-awareness.
- **Temporal Certainty Binding**: Positions consciousness as a real-time certainty signal linking past, present, and future states.

In this model, consciousness arises when a system recursively processes imperfectly encoded past states via context-invariant neural coding. This approach provides a mechanistic explanation and directly addresses the phenomenology of subjective experience, including subject-level error detection—a key feature distinguishing conscious from unconscious processes. Unlike PP’s focus on minimizing errors, our framework emphasizes how systematic misclassification and preservation of errors in higher-level loops are essential for consciousness. Moreover, neuroscientific findings on the default mode network (DMN), frontoparietal areas, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) support these ideas.

## Universal Tape Model

The universe is modeled as a "Universal Tape" (T), holding an evolving informational state \( I(t) \in \mathcal{I} \), updated as:
\[
I(t+1) = U(I(t)),
\]
where \( U \) is the state transition function. Observers encode this state into memory:
\[
M(t) = F(I(t)), \quad M(t) \in \mathcal{M},
\]
where \( \mathcal{M} \) is lower-dimensional than \( \mathcal{I} \). This encoding is inherently lossy:
\[
M(t - \Delta t) = I(t - \Delta t) + \varepsilon, \quad \varepsilon \neq 0,
\]
with \( \varepsilon \) representing noise or bias. This imperfection is not a mere limitation but a driver of the recursive processes central to consciousness.

## Memory as Imperfect Encoding
Memory encoding is defined as:
\[
M(t) = F(I(t)) = I(t) + \varepsilon(t), \quad \varepsilon(t) \neq 0,
\]
where \( \varepsilon(t) \) captures errors. Imperfect encoding enables generalization or adaptability—traits essential for subjective experience. Psychological evidence shows memory is reconstructive rather than reproductive, aligning with this encoding model.

## Recursive Recognition and Continuity
Consciousness arises from recursive comparison of current states with imperfect memories:
\[
R(I(t), M(t - \Delta t)) = 
\begin{cases}
\text{"same"} & \text{if } d(I(t), M(t - \Delta t)) < \epsilon, \\
\text{"different"} & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\]
where \( d \) is a distance metric and \( \epsilon \) is a threshold. Continuity emerges through systematic misclassification, essential for subjective experience.

## Distinction from Predictive Processing (PP)
While PP seeks to minimize errors, this framework treats errors as crucial for subjective continuity and self-awareness. Errors become consciously experienced mismatches rather than mere signals for updating predictions.

## Subject-Level Error Detection
Subject-level error detection ("I am wrong") integrates internal mismatches into conscious experience, unlike automatic sub-personal error detection. This is empirically supported by activity in the default mode network (DMN) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).

## Formalizing Error Detection
Subjective errors occur when external evidence \( E(t) \) conflicts significantly with encoded memory:
\[
\text{discrepancy}(t) = d(M(t - \Delta t), E(t)), \quad \text{if discrepancy}(t) > \theta, \quad \text{conscious experience emerges},
\]
where \( \theta \) is an error-awareness threshold.

## Informational State Classifications
- **Fully Recursive**: Exact repeats; rare.
- **Quasi-Recursive**: Approximate repetition enabling consciousness.
- **Non-Recursive**: Rarely contributes to consciousness.

## Context-Invariant Representations
Humans encode stable, context-invariant representations, essential for recognizing the self consistently across time and environments, as observed in medial temporal lobe structures.

## Temporal Certainty Binding
Consciousness integrates temporal certainty signals:
\[
C(t) = \sum_{i}\left[ \alpha_i P(S_t | S_{t-1}) + \beta_i P(S_{t+1} | S_t) \right],
\]
linking past, present, and future states into coherent experiences.

## Bridging to Psychopathology
Psychopathologies such as confabulation represent failures in subject-level error detection, offering a framework for understanding consciousness breakdowns.

## Addressing Objections
- **Conscious vs. Unconscious**: Recursive self-reference and subject-level error detection are key differentiators.
- **Non-zero Errors**: Error-free encoding inhibits consciousness by preventing adaptability.
- **Abstraction**: Simplifications enhance testability and clarity.

## Novel Contributions
Unlike IIT or GWT, this model emphasizes recursive processing, error preservation, temporal certainty binding, and empirical grounding in neuroscience.

## Testable Predictions
- **Neural studies**: Gamma coherence alterations (EEG) linked to consciousness disruption.
- **Computational simulations**: Varying encoding imperfection (\( \varepsilon \)) affects self-awareness.
- **Behavioral experiments**: Testing context-invariant neural representations via fMRI tasks.

## Addressing Psychopathology
Psychopathologies provide "stress tests," demonstrating consequences of disrupted subject-level error detection, such as depersonalization or confabulation.

## Conclusion
This computational framework integrates recursive processing, imperfect encoding, context-invariant representation, and temporal binding, advancing testable hypotheses grounded in neuroscience.
