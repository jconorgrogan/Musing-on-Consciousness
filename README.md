# Musing-on-Consciousness

Here is my scratch pad for my latest/greatest thoughts on some of the core open questions about consciousness:

## I. Consciousness and Structural Memory

- Consciousness remains poorly defined and not fully understood, especially regarding what specifically distinguishes human consciousness from animal awareness or cognition.

- Humans consistently display robust markers of consciousness distinct from other animals—for instance, humans reliably pass the mirror self-recognition test, while animals generally fail or pass only inconsistently or situationally.

- Stable, context-independent awareness appears central to consciousness; therefore, examining uniquely human neural structures and coding patterns—particularly those involved in memory, identity, and self-recognition—is crucial.

- A recent study (Rey et al., 2025, *Cell Reports*) identifies a significant human-specific neural mechanism: neurons in the human medial temporal lobe encode memories in a stable, context-invariant manner. This contrasts sharply with other species, whose neurons typically encode memories in a context-dependent, conjunctive manner.

- (Speculative extension): Human consciousness and the concept of "self" may emerge directly from this neural invariance. Whereas animals might briefly recognize themselves situationally, humans maintain a consistent and abstract neural representation of "self," transcending specific contexts or momentary circumstances.

- This context-invariant neural coding potentially underlies the human capacity for coherent self-awareness and identity continuity, enabling humans to preserve a stable sense of self despite ongoing physical, psychological, and environmental changes.

## II. Consciousness as Recursive Retrieval of Context-Invariant Representations

- Extending the idea from Rey et al. (2025), consciousness might fundamentally depend on the brain's ability to access stable, context-invariant neural representations—not only for the "self," but also for lower-level concepts such as objects, people, places, and, also, emotions.

- Conscious experience could thus arise from the process of retrieving these invariant representations repeatedly and recursively, with each retrieval implicitly referencing previous retrieval events.

- Each conscious act becomes a comparison: the brain assesses current retrieval against prior retrievals of the same stable representation. This recursive referencing occurs across multiple hierarchical levels—from simple concepts to the abstract concept of "self."

- Subjective feeling ("what it is like") emerges naturally from this internal referencing process, as the brain continuously evaluates how current experience aligns or contrasts with past retrieval episodes, generating a rich, consistent sense of awareness.

- Thus, human consciousness is distinguished from animal awareness by the systematic, internal, and recursive referencing of stable, context-invariant representations, creating a continuous, coherent subjective experience across time.
